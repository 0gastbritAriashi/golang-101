    ```diff
    + Package
    ```

----------------------------------------

## Basics
```diff
+ Package
```
- All package files, should be in the same (single) directory. i.e. all package source code files should be located in a one single directory.
- All files in a specific folder should belong to a one single package. It's a convention, not a rule.
- To make a package executable, name that package `main`. It's a special package.
- `package` clause can be used only once per file and it should be the first line in `.go` source file.
- Package contains multiple `Go` files belonging to same folder.
