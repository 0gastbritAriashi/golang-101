    ```diff
    + Packages
    + Executable Packages
    ```

----------------------------------------

## Basics
```diff
+ Packages
```
- All package files, should be in the same (single) directory. i.e. all package source code files should be located in a one single directory.
- All files in a specific folder should belong to a one single package. It's a convention, not a rule.
> There are 2 kinds of packages in Go: `Executable Packages` and `Library Packages`.
- To make a package executable, name that package `main`. It's a special package.
- `package` clause can be used only once per file and it should be the first line in `.go` source file.
- Package contains multiple `Go` files belonging to same folder.

```diff
+ Executable Packages
```
- It's name should always be `package main`.
- `Executable Package` should also contain `main()` function and that too only once.
